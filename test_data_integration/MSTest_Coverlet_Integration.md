## Execution of MSTest in Embold Jenkins Plugin
Below is the link to a simple C# repository that contains MSTest cases and can be built using msbuild16 which will be used for reference in the commands used for running MSTest throughout this article: https://github.com/CMARIXTechnolabs/UnitTesting-MSTest-Examples

Before you begin executing MSTest, make sure Jenkins has to be configured according to the below two stages**Jenkins Configuration**
Steps to configure Jenkins:
1. Click Manage Jenkins and go to Manage Plugins link. More information here: https://docs.embold.io/installation-and-backup-guide/#configure-plugin-logs
- **Install MSTest plugin**– This plugin converts MSTest TRX test reports into XML reports used by Embold.
2. Click Manage Jenkins link and go under Global Tool Configuration.
- Install the **MSBuild Plugin** – This plugin helps to build a Visual Studio project (.proj) and solution files (.sln).
- Following two inputs are required here:
 - MSBuild.exe: Name of the MSBuild file should be mentioned.
 - ```C:/ProgramFiles(x86)/MSBuild/14.0/Bin/MSBuild.exe:``` Location of the MSBuild on the Jenkins machine should be mentioned.
**Note**- The MSTest plugin analyzes the Test Execution Report (TRX) generated by MSTest. Hence, the output of MSTest is stored in TRX file.
